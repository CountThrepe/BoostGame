Boost Game

A month long project for September 2020. This is my first game ever, and I set out to learn Unity, Rider, and the general game development process in a month, and this is the final result. I am a programmer, not a visual artist, and I was purely focusing on the gameplay for this game which is why I used placeholders for all the art. The goal was to create an extremely simple game while still having depth to the gameplay.

Gameplay:
This is a platformer, and your only input is jump. Collect boosts to speed up, and keep collecting or your speed will run out. However, be careful of collecting too many; your speed has no limit. Running into a wall cuts your speed in half, stranding you with no boosts, or potentially bringing you down to a manageable speed.
